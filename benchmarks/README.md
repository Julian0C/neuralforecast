# Performance and comparison benchmarks

In this section we provide reproducible benchmarks fitting a selection of time-series
to both classical versions of prediction models and their neural network incarnations.
In particular, we'll be generating ```ARMA(p, q)``` time-series, fit the
respective models, measure loss and retrieve ```ARMA``` parameters on test data.
